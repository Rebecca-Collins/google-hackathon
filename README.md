# Google Access

Google Access was developed from scratch in just 20 hours as a part of a hackathon event. My team created a new version of Google's accessibility page with additional features, allowing users to personalize their accessibility settings and save them across all Google products. The G-Access Toolbar, a feature we also created, allows users to fine-tune accessibility elements directly on the page, such as text size and color contrast.

Getting Started:

To get started with Google Access, you can install the necessary dependencies by running npm i in the root directory, then start the application with npm start.

Technologies Used: 

React.js, Javascript, SCSS
